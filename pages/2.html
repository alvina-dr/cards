<p class="">It looked at a vast meadow and in its center there was a lonely windmill solely turning because of the wind. Enough energy was made to power the little house beside it.

    Entering the house there was a library. In the library it looked the letter and on the side she watched the little flower. 
    
    The flower was happy and when she was watering the flower grow until becoming a tree.
    
    And many card drop of the tree.</p>
