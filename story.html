    <h1>The World of the Cards</h1>

    <p>For many years, cards represented the world.

        Their world may be like ours.

        The story begins with one card.

        This card wanted to travel the world. It wanted to see its people and their way of life.

        They say travelling is growing up. And the lonely card learned so much.
    </p>

    <h2> Castle</h2>
    <p>
        Its first trip was to Asia. There, it discovered a castle fully made of cards. And it learned that each card
        composing it had an important role. It saw the sharing and the responsibility. For if only one card falls, all
        the
        other falls with it.

        Thinking back to all the other cards she was part of before getting separated, her deck, her family, she knew
        that
        she wasn't really alone, that she was a part of a whole.

        (Responsabilité, Société, Partage)
    </p>

    <h2>Meadow :</h2>

    <p>

        It looked at a vast meadow and in its center there was a lonely windmill solely turning because of the wind.
        Enough
        energy was made to power the little house beside it.

        Entering the house there was a library. In the library it looked the letter and on the side she watched the
        little
        flower.

        The flower was happy and when she was watering the flower grow until becoming a tree.

        And many card drop of the tree.
    </p>

    <h2> Plane :</h2>

    <p>

        Above the tree it looked at a plane. It jumped in the plane

        During the flight it watched the seventh continent. The polution, the waste .

        The planet is seen from above.

        it is easier to see the problems from above
    </p>

    <h2>Ship :</h2>

    <p>

        The plane started to go down, go down... Then after a moment the plane transformed into a ship.

        The capitain of the ship is an old marine. And on the water there are dead cards.

        On the card there was no drawing anymore.

        After a moment the ship bumped a new country.
    </p>



    <h2> New Country :</h2>

    <p>

        Card arrived in a new country. In this country the people is a ants. They are all organised, they help each
        other

        people are happy and friendly

        But the card donsnt not speak the same language.

        And the communication is key to everything

        and it arrived in the united state.
