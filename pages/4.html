<p class="">The plane started to go down, go down... Then after a moment the plane transformed into a ship.

    The capitain of the ship is an old marine. And on the water there are dead cards.
    
    On the card there was no drawing anymore.
    
    After a moment the ship bumped a new country.</p>
